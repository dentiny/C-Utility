### Executor
This class is created for threadpool, which support different functions, with limited kinds of different types of integers.

For example, f1() take a int* as argument, and no return type.

Meanwhile, f2() takes no argument, and also with no return type.

You could extend this list by adding function types in the constants.hpp.
